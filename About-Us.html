We believe in teaching through a biblical and positive perspective. Our goal is to keep as many people as we can from becoming another statistic. The W.O.R.T.H. mentors people from all walks of life. We believe that through patience, experience, and love, each person can soar above their circumstances. We give people the tools necessary to break through the barriers of their life situations.</p>
